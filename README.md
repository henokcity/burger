## Description

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

* The app lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

    SO THAT I can manage the log and the database entery

## Business-Context

Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. This server side application attempt to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Development-Strategy

Design the following database schema:


   * Create the `burgers_db`.
   * Switch to or use the `burgers_db`.
   * Create a `burgers` table with these fields:
     * **id**: an auto incrementing int that serves as the primary key.
     * **burger_name**: a string.
     * **devoured**: a boolean.
